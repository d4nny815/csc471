## Inifitie Void

You should see a scene of an anime character (Gojo) fighting a Pokemon (Charizard) in a forest with a 2 canines playing slots away from society. Currently Gojo is my favorite anime character, because of all the memes hes a part of, and I wanted to include in a something and this was the perfect project(I am going to make an Instagram Reel about this). As a lifetime Pokemon fan, Charizard (first Pokemon .obj I found) was the clear answer to be his opponent. After getting the fighting orb moving, it reminded me of the Aang's Avatar State Scene against Ozai, where he had all the elements around him, so I wanted to recreate it. Then I accidently added 2 sin functions and thought it was cooler I added around Gojo. I enjoy recreational gambling(when I win) so I had to add it with 2 players, a dog and a wolf(I like dogs). I was then told I should added a floor so I did at the end(it wasnt in my original scene).


## Finding Objs
It was NOT hard finding objs for most of scene since I was just browing the selection for cool ones that were .obj. Gojo was first a .blend file that I convert to an obj in Blender. A lot of the more complicated designs were different file types, which I assume included other data like texture, color, etc.
